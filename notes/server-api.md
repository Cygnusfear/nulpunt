# Document selection and ordering

This part deals with document selection and ordering.

### GET /trending

This retrieves a list of documents that are sorted to the  'trending' criterium.

Trending can be defined simply as 'ordered by timestamp of latest annotation'. It will be a 'jumpy' list.

Or more complex as weighted number of anntations and comments in the last X minutes.

The server keeps a mostly static list of trending documents. This to keep the amount of work at request time to a minimum. This is really important for this call, as it will be used for every request at the home page. IE, everyone.

Clients can request parts of the list that they are interested in. (to make lazy loading possible)

Parameters: 
- startAt; position in the list where to start; 0 is the most trending one.
- limit; max number of documents to return
- nrOfAnnotations; number of recent annotations per trending document

Returns:
- a list of documents. (max 50)
  For each document expect: 
  - document-record (as in the database.md)
  - []annotation-records (as in db)
  - []pages-records (as in db) that are specified in the annotations
  - []crops of the images, one for each annotation.

This response contains all that's needed to show the trending page.

Expected use:
* Front end code starts with a call to GET /trending with startAt 0, limit to what is wanted (1, 3, ...) and NrOfAnnotations to what's wanted.
* Front end displays page;
* user presses buttons on the pages to see more (older) trending data. Can load lazily, just change the start-at parameter.
