			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h3>How do I contribute to the development of 0.?</h3>
			<p>0. is a project in development and we encourage users to contribute to 0. either by contributing to the code or by sending in documents. 0. is developed as an open source program on GitHub. For information on contributing or submitting ideas, please e-mail renee@nulpunt.nu</p>
			<h3>Can I upload documents myself?</h3>
			<p>Not at this moment. We are working on expanding the functionalities of 0., including the possibility for users to upload their own requested government documents. In the meantime you can send us the documents you deem relevant for 0. through e-mail or transfer services to admin@nulpunt.nu</p>
			<h3>Why can I not retrieve or change my password?</h3>
			<p>0. uses client side encryption. This means that 0. encrypts your data before sending it to the server. This allows 0. to guarantee a higher degree of privacy as the provider cannot access the data of users. It, however, also means your password is only known to you, and not to us. When you forget your password, we cannot retrieve it for you.</p>
			<h3>How are the documents in the 0. database acquired?</h3>
			<p>The documents that are currently available in 0. are either freely published by governments, organizations and corporations or acquired by individual reporters and researchers by means of the Freedom of Information Act (Dutch: “Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur”).</p>
			<h3>How is 0. licensed?</h3>
			<p>0. is being developed under the GNU General Public License 3. This gives the public the right to copy, distribute and modify the software and guarantees these offspring to be publicly available too. The copyright of the documents in the database of 0. lie with the authors of the respective texts.</p>
